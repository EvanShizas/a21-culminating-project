# Project Repository Information
A21 - Haevin Chess Game

This is going to be the project folder where all the work will be completed. 
Make sure to have the versions being worked on stored in their respective version types (alpha, beta, pre-release), with any older versions being backed-up according to the rules listed in the package README.md! 

Version Number Info:
- 0.0.# --> Alpha
- 0.#.# --> Beta
- 1.0.0-preRelease## --> Pre-Release
- 1.0.0 --> Release/Final

Backup Information:
- Create a folder containing the version number of the previous version (ex. 0.0.1)
- Copy the Java Class file into the backup folder
- Change the version number of the current Java Class file, following the numbering rules for its respective package 

Present Java Class files will be listed in the root of the package...

Please view the other READMEs listed throughout the project folder!

Whenever making a commit, make sure to explicitly state what is changed/added for clarity purposes. As well, within the code itself, there should be a "Patch Notes" 
comment created. Use that comment field to state what was changed/created. State the line number if possible, as well as the date the change was made. Will allow for
easier tracking of what was done, so other collaborators may be able to know what is going on.

If a commit is to be made that is quite a major change/addition, please create a secondary branch and speak to the other collaborators before adding to main, as it may
cause complications in the project repository that will take time to fix (unecessary trouble).

This README.md will updated as the project progresses...
