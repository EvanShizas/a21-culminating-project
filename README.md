# Project Repository Information
A21 - Haevin Chess Game

This is going to be the project folder where all the work will be completed. 
Make sure to have the versions being worked on stored in their respective version types (alpha, beta, pre-release), with any older versions being backed-up according to the rules listed in the package README.md! 

Version Number Info:
- 0.0.# --> Alpha
- 0.#.# --> Beta
- 1.0.0-preRelease## --> Pre-Release
- 1.0.0 --> Release/Final

Backup Information:
- Go to the ".../a21-culminating-project/backups/" directory and create a folder containing the version number of the previous version (ex. 0.0.1)
- Copy the Java Class file into the backup folder
- Change the version number of the current Java Class file, following the numbering rules for its respective package 

Present Java Class files will be listed in the root of the package...

Please view the other READMEs listed throughout the project folder!

Whenever making a commit, make sure to explicitly state what is changed/added for clarity purposes. As well, within the code itself, there should be a "Patch Notes" 
comment created. Use that comment field to state what was changed/created. State the line number if possible, as well as the date the change was made. Will allow for
easier tracking of what was done, so other collaborators may be able to know what is going on.

If a commit is to be made that is quite a major change/addition, please create a secondary branch and speak to the other collaborators before adding to main, as it may
cause complications in the project repository that will take time to fix (unecessary trouble).

To now load the game, it's as simple as last time. Have any of the classes open and compile/run. Since the main is only located in "HaevinChess.java", as long as the launch is taking place in the same root directory as that class file, the entire program should load just fine. Please let me know if any issues occur!

Note: "~Properties.java" files contain all the code within methods called in the main class (HaevinChess.java). DO NOT IMPLEMENT A STATIC MAIN METHOD IN ANY JAVA CLASSES OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN PROGRAM! This may cause compiling errors! If any new piece-specific rules/moves are to be created, code them in their respective "~Properties.java" files. If things are to be added that do not correlate to any of the existing methods, please create a new one!

This README.md will updated as the project progresses...
