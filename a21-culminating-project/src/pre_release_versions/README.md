# Package Information

Package intended to store Java files with version numbers 1.0.0-preRelease##

Used to indicate that the Java file is near release version. 

Package may also be allowed to store Java files with version numbers greater than 1.0.0 (ex. version 1.2.4), as long as final release is set to version 1.0.0, or whichever version number is set based on updates to final version (i.e. 1.0.0 --> 1.1.0, no version 2.0.0)

When a new version is to be made, please create a folder containing the version number of the previous version in
the ".../a21-culminating-project/backups/" directory to allow for backups of older program versions. This is for backup purposes!

Present Java Class files will be listed in the root of the package...
